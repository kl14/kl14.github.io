<P> The University of Maine at Orono hosts AOII's Gamma Chapter. This chapter was founded by one
of the four original founding sisters, Helen St. Clair Mullan in 1908. To this day we continue
to hold our founding sister's values and do as much as we can to service others. We hold various
events during the year to fundraise money to go towards The Arthritis Foundation. Our chapter
specializes in helping out with Juvenile Arthritis.
